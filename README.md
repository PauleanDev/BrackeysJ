**A Question of Taste** is a 2D point-and-click baking game simulator where you don't have enough ingredients! No chocolate for chocolate chips, no strawbery for strawberry biscuits. It's now your job to improvise: honey, ketchup, or wasabi. Questionable ingredients with questionable risks. <br>

Deduce preferences from clients, work on limited information, and take risks to bake the right cookie with the right taste. <br>

## Controls
- Move by point and clicking on the screen
- Talk to client and get their preferences. You can only ask three questions!
- Create the basic cookie by gathering butter, egg, and flour
- Later on, create stranger cookies by gathering wasabi, honey, or ketchup in the storage room
- Put the dough in the oven. Put the tray on the table, then grab a package from the box by the mixing table.
- Once cookie is done baking, use the package to take them out of the oven.
